# Buzz Code Challenge

## Running the project

1. If you do not have `nvm` installed, install it by following the directions [here](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).
1. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal and run `nvm use`. If necessary, install the appropriate version of node as directed by `nvm`.
1. Run `npm i` to install project dependencies.
1. Run `npm run start:server` to start the node server.
1. In a separate terminal window run `npm start` in the project directory to start the react app.
1. The site should be automatically opened in your default browser at `http://localhost:3000`.
1. Have fun exploring the site!

## Note on Testing

Given more time I would have liked to have written some unit tests to go along with this. I think that's
the major thing that's currently lacking. I just want to acknowledge that this needs tests and it's only
in the interest of time that I'm leaving them out here.
